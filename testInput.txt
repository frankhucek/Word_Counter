Chapter 1

[1:1] In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth,
[1:2] the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters.
[1:3] Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light.
[1:4] And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.
[1:5] God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
[1:6] And God said, "Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."
[1:7] So God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome from the waters that were above the dome. And it was so.
[1:8] God called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.
[1:9] And God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so.
[1:10] God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
[1:11] Then God said, "Let the earth put forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it." And it was so.
[1:12] The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And God saw that it was good.
[1:13] And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
[1:14] And God said, "Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years,
[1:15] and let them be lights in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth." And it was so.
[1:16] God made the two great lights - the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night - and the stars.
[1:17] God set them in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth,
[1:18] to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
[1:19] And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
[1:20] And God said, "Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky."
[1:21] So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, of every kind, with which the waters swarm, and every winged bird of every kind. And God saw that it was good.
[1:22] God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
[1:23] And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.
[1:24] And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind: cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth of every kind." And it was so.
[1:25] God made the wild animals of the earth of every kind, and the cattle of every kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground of every kind. And God saw that it was good.
[1:26] Then God said, "Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth."
[1:27] So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.
[1:28] God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth."
[1:29] God said, "See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food.
[1:30] And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food." And it was so.
[1:31] God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

Chapter 2

[2:1] Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude.
[2:2] And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done.
[2:3] So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the work that he had done in creation.
[2:4] These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created. In the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
[2:5] when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up - for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no one to till the ground;
[2:6] but a stream would rise from the earth, and water the whole face of the ground -
[2:7] then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.
[2:8] And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
[2:9] Out of the ground the LORD God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[2:10] A river flows out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divides and becomes four branches.
[2:11] The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
[2:12] and the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.
[2:13] The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Cush.
[2:14] The name of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
[2:15] The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it.
[2:16] And the LORD God commanded the man, "You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;
[2:17] but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die."
[2:18] Then the LORD God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper as his partner."
[2:19] So out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.
[2:20] The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper as his partner.
[2:21] So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
[2:22] And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.
[2:23] Then the man said, "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; this one shall be called Woman, for out of Man this one was taken."
[2:24] Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh.
[2:25] And the man and his wife were both naked, and were not ashamed.
Chapter 3

[3:1] Now the serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God say, 'You shall not eat from any tree in the garden'?"
[3:2] The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden;
[3:3] but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, nor shall you touch it, or you shall die. '"
[3:4] But the serpent said to the woman, "You will not die;
[3:5] for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
[3:6] So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate.
[3:7] Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.
[3:8] They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
[3:9] But the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"
[3:10] He said, "I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
[3:11] He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"
[3:12] The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate."
[3:13] Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent tricked me, and I ate."
[3:14] The LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you among all animals and among all wild creatures; upon your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
[3:15] I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will strike your head, and you will strike his heel."
[3:16] To the woman he said, "I will greatly increase your pangs in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you."
[3:17] And to the man he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree about which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life;
[3:18] thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.
[3:19] By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return."
[3:20] The man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
[3:21] And the LORD God made garments of skins for the man and for his wife, and clothed them.
[3:22] Then the LORD God said, "See, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever"--
[3:23] therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
[3:24] He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim, and a sword flaming and turning to guard the way to the tree of life.
Chapter 4

[4:1] Now the man knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, "I have produced a man with the help of the LORD."
[4:2] Next she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground.
[4:3] In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground,
[4:4] and Abel for his part brought of the firstlings of his flock, their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering,
[4:5] but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
[4:6] The LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?
[4:7] If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it."
[4:8] Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let us go out to the field." And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him.
[4:9] Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" He said, "I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?"
[4:10] And the LORD said, "What have you done? Listen; your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground!
[4:11] And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
[4:12] When you till the ground, it will no longer yield to you its strength; you will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth."
[4:13] Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is greater than I can bear!
[4:14] Today you have driven me away from the soil, and I shall be hidden from your face; I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and anyone who meets me may kill me."
[4:15] Then the LORD said to him, "Not so! Whoever kills Cain will suffer a sevenfold vengeance." And the LORD put a mark on Cain, so that no one who came upon him would kill him.
[4:16] Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
[4:17] Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and named it Enoch after his son Enoch.
[4:18] To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael the father of Methushael, and Methushael the father of Lamech.
[4:19] Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
[4:20] Adah bore Jabal; he was the ancestor of those who live in tents and have livestock.
[4:21] His brother's name was Jubal; he was the ancestor of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
[4:22] Zillah bore Tubal-cain, who made all kinds of bronze and iron tools. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
[4:23] Lamech said to his wives: "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say: I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.
[4:24] If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold."
[4:25] Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, for she said, "God has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, because Cain killed him."
[4:26] To Seth also a son was born, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to invoke the name of the LORD.

Chapter 5

[5:1] This is the list of the descendants of Adam. When God created humankind, he made them in the likeness of God.
[5:2] Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them "Humankind" when they were created.
[5:3] When Adam had lived one hundred thirty years, he became the father of a son in his likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth.
[5:4] The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years; and he had other sons and daughters.
[5:5] Thus all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years; and he died.
[5:6] When Seth had lived one hundred five years, he became the father of Enosh.
[5:7] Seth lived after the birth of Enosh eight hundred seven years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:8] Thus all the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years; and he died.
[5:9] When Enosh had lived ninety years, he became the father of Kenan.
[5:10] Enosh lived after the birth of Kenan eight hundred fifteen years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:11] Thus all the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years; and he died.
[5:12] When Kenan had lived seventy years, he became the father of Mahalalel.
[5:13] Kenan lived after the birth of Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:14] Thus all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
[5:15] When Mahalalel had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Jared.
[5:16] Mahalalel lived after the birth of Jared eight hundred thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:17] Thus all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years; and he died.
[5:18] When Jared had lived one hundred sixty-two years he became the father of Enoch.
[5:19] Jared lived after the birth of Enoch eight hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:20] Thus all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years; and he died.
[5:21] When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Methuselah.
[5:22] Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah three hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:23] Thus all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.
[5:24] Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him.
[5:25] When Methuselah had lived one hundred eighty-seven years, he became the father of Lamech.
[5:26] Methuselah lived after the birth of Lamech seven hundred eighty- two years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:27] Thus all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years; and he died.
[5:28] When Lamech had lived one hundred eighty-two years, he became the father of a son;
[5:29] he named him Noah, saying, "Out of the ground that the LORD has cursed this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the toil of our hands."
[5:30] Lamech lived after the birth of Noah five hundred ninety-five years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:31] Thus all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years; and he died.
[5:32] After Noah was five hundred years old, Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

Chapter 6

[6:1] When people began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them,
[6:2] the sons of God saw that they were fair; and they took wives for themselves of all that they chose.
[6:3] Then the LORD said, "My spirit shall not abide in mortals forever, for they are flesh; their days shall be one hundred twenty years."
[6:4] The Nephilim were on the earth in those days - and also afterward - when the sons of God went in to the daughters of humans, who bore children to them. These were the heroes that were of old, warriors of renown.
[6:5] The LORD saw that the wickedness of humankind was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually.
[6:6] And the LORD was sorry that he had made humankind on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.
[6:7] So the LORD said, "I will blot out from the earth the human beings I have created - people together with animals and creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them."
[6:8] But Noah found favor in the sight of the LORD.
[6:9] These are the descendants of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.
[6:10] And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
[6:11] Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence.
[6:12] And God saw that the earth was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted its ways upon the earth.
[6:13] And God said to Noah, "I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence because of them; now I am going to destroy them along with the earth.
[6:14] Make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.
[6:15] This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.
[6:16] Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above; and put the door of the ark in its side; make it with lower, second, and third decks.
[6:17] For my part, I am going to bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die.
[6:18] But I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
[6:19] And of every living thing, of all flesh, you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.
[6:20] Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind, two of every kind shall come in to you, to keep them alive.
[6:21] Also take with you every kind of food that is eaten, and store it up; and it shall serve as food for you and for them."
[6:22] Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.
Chapter 7

[7:1] Then the LORD said to Noah, "Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you alone are righteous before me in this generation.
[7:2] Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and its mate; and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and its mate;
[7:3] and seven pairs of the birds of the air also, male and female, to keep their kind alive on the face of all the earth.
[7:4] For in seven days I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground."
[7:5] And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.
[7:6] Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth.
[7:7] And Noah with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
[7:8] Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,
[7:9] two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah.
[7:10] And after seven days the waters of the flood came on the earth.
[7:11] In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.
[7:12] The rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.
[7:13] On the very same day Noah with his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons entered the ark,
[7:14] they and every wild animal of every kind, and all domestic animals of every kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every bird of every kind - every bird, every winged creature.
[7:15] They went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.
[7:16] And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the LORD shut him in.
[7:17] The flood continued forty days on the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.
[7:18] The waters swelled and increased greatly on the earth; and the ark floated on the face of the waters.
[7:19] The waters swelled so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered;
[7:20] the waters swelled above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep.
[7:21] And all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, domestic animals, wild animals, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all human beings;
[7:22] everything on dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.
[7:23] He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, human beings and animals and creeping things and birds of the air; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark.
[7:24] And the waters swelled on the earth for one hundred fifty days.
Chapter 8

[8:1] But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and all the domestic animals that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided;
[8:2] the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained,
[8:3] and the waters gradually receded from the earth. At the end of one hundred fifty days the waters had abated;
[8:4] and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
[8:5] The waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.
[8:6] At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made
[8:7] and sent out the raven; and it went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.
[8:8] Then he sent out the dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground;
[8:9] but the dove found no place to set its foot, and it returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took it and brought it into the ark with him.
[8:10] He waited another seven days, and again he sent out the dove from the ark;
[8:11] and the dove came back to him in the evening, and there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf; so Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.
[8:12] Then he waited another seven days, and sent out the dove; and it did not return to him any more.
[8:13] In the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and saw that the face of the ground was drying.
[8:14] In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
[8:15] Then God said to Noah,
[8:16] "Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you.
[8:17] Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh - birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth - so that they may abound on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth."
[8:18] So Noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives.
[8:19] And every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out of the ark by families.
[8:20] Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
[8:21] And when the LORD smelled the pleasing odor, the LORD said in his heart, "I will never again curse the ground because of humankind, for the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.
[8:22] As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease."
Chapter 9

[9:1] God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.
[9:2] The fear and dread of you shall rest on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the air, on everything that creeps on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered.
[9:3] Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and just as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.
[9:4] Only, you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.
[9:5] For your own lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning: from every animal I will require it and from human beings, each one for the blood of another, I will require a reckoning for human life.
[9:6] Whoever sheds the blood of a human, by a human shall that person's blood be shed; for in his own image God made humankind.
[9:7] And you, be fruitful and multiply, abound on the earth and multiply in it."
[9:8] Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,
[9:9] "As for me, I am establishing my covenant with you and your descendants after you,
[9:10] and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the domestic animals, and every animal of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark.
[9:11] I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth."
[9:12] God said, "This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:
[9:13] I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
[9:14] When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds,
[9:15] I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.
[9:16] When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."
[9:17] God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."
[9:18] The sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan.
[9:19] These three were the sons of Noah; and from these the whole earth was peopled.
[9:20] Noah, a man of the soil, was the first to plant a vineyard.
[9:21] He drank some of the wine and became drunk, and he lay uncovered in his tent.
[9:22] And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.
[9:23] Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father's nakedness.
[9:24] When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him,
[9:25] he said, "Cursed be Canaan; lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers."
[9:26] He also said, "Blessed by the LORD my God be Shem; and let Canaan be his slave.
[9:27] May God make space for Japheth, and let him live in the tents of Shem; and let Canaan be his slave."
[9:28] After the flood Noah lived three hundred fifty years.
[9:29] All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years; and he died.
Chapter 10

[10:1] These are the descendants of Noah's sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth; children were born to them after the flood.
[10:2] The descendants of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
[10:3] The descendants of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
[10:4] The descendants of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Rodanim.
[10:5] From these the coastland peoples spread. These are the descendants of Japheth in their lands, with their own language, by their families, in their nations.
[10:6] The descendants of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan.
[10:7] The descendants of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The descendants of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
[10:8] Cush became the father of Nimrod; he was the first on earth to become a mighty warrior.
[10:9] He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD."
[10:10] The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, and Accad, all of them in the land of Shinar.
[10:11] From that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-ir, Calah, and
[10:12] Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
[10:13] Egypt became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
[10:14] Pathrusim, Casluhim, and Caphtorim, from which the Philistines come.
[10:15] Canaan became the father of Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,
[10:16] and the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,
[10:17] the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,
[10:18] the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
[10:19] And the territory of the Canaanites extended from Sidon, in the direction of Gerar, as far as Gaza, and in the direction of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
[10:20] These are the descendants of Ham, by their families, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
[10:21] To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, children were born.
[10:22] The descendants of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
[10:23] The descendants of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
[10:24] Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber.
[10:25] To Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided, and his brother's name was Joktan.
[10:26] Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
[10:27] Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
[10:28] Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
[10:29] Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the descendants of Joktan.
[10:30] The territory in which they lived extended from Mesha in the direction of Sephar, the hill country of the east.
[10:31] These are the descendants of Shem, by their families, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
[10:32] These are the families of Noah's sons, according to their genealogies, in their nations; and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood.
Chapter 11

[11:1] Now the whole earth had one language and the same words.
[11:2] And as they migrated from the east, they came upon a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
[11:3] And they said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar.
[11:4] Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth."
[11:5] The LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which mortals had built.
[11:6] And the LORD said, "Look, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.
[11:7] Come, let us go down, and confuse their language there, so that they will not understand one another's speech."
[11:8] So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.
[11:9] Therefore it was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.
[11:10] These are the descendants of Shem. When Shem was one hundred years old, he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood;
[11:11] and Shem lived after the birth of Arpachshad five hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:12] When Arpachshad had lived thirty-five years, he became the father of Shelah;
[11:13] and Arpachshad lived after the birth of Shelah four hundred three years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:14] When Shelah had lived thirty years, he became the father of Eber;
[11:15] and Shelah lived after the birth of Eber four hundred three years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:16] When Eber had lived thirty-four years, he became the father of Peleg;
[11:17] and Eber lived after the birth of Peleg four hundred thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:18] When Peleg had lived thirty years, he became the father of Reu;
[11:19] and Peleg lived after the birth of Reu two hundred nine years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:20] When Reu had lived thirty-two years, he became the father of Serug;
[11:21] and Reu lived after the birth of Serug two hundred seven years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:22] When Serug had lived thirty years, he became the father of Nahor;
[11:23] and Serug lived after the birth of Nahor two hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:24] When Nahor had lived twenty-nine years, he became the father of Terah;
[11:25] and Nahor lived after the birth of Terah one hundred nineteen years, and had other sons and daughters.
[11:26] When Terah had lived seventy years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
[11:27] Now these are the descendants of Terah. Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot.
[11:28] Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
[11:29] Abram and Nahor took wives; the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah. She was the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah.
[11:30] Now Sarai was barren; she had no child.
[11:31] Terah took his son Abram and his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram's wife, and they went out together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan; but when they came to Haran, they settled there.
[11:32] The days of Terah were two hundred five years; and Terah died in Haran.

Chapter 12

[12:1] Now the LORD said to Abram, "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
[12:2] I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.
[12:3] I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse; and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
[12:4] So Abram went, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
[12:5] Abram took his wife Sarai and his brother's son Lot, and all the possessions that they had gathered, and the persons whom they had acquired in Haran; and they set forth to go to the land of Canaan. When they had come to the land of Canaan,
[12:6] Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
[12:7] Then the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, "To your offspring I will give this land." So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.
[12:8] From there he moved on to the hill country on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the LORD and invoked the name of the LORD.
[12:9] And Abram journeyed on by stages toward the Negeb.
[12:10] Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to reside there as an alien, for the famine was severe in the land.
[12:11] When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, "I know well that you are a woman beautiful in appearance;
[12:12] and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife'; then they will kill me, but they will let you live.
[12:13] Say you are my sister, so that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared on your account."
[12:14] When Abram entered Egypt the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
[12:15] When the officials of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
[12:16] And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male and female slaves, female donkeys, and camels.
[12:17] But the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
[12:18] So Pharaoh called Abram, and said, "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
[12:19] Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife, take her, and be gone."
[12:20] And Pharaoh gave his men orders concerning him; and they set him on the way, with his wife and all that he had.

Chapter 13

[13:1] So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.
[13:2] Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
[13:3] He journeyed on by stages from the Negeb as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
[13:4] to the place where he had made an altar at the first; and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
[13:5] Now Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents,
[13:6] so that the land could not support both of them living together; for their possessions were so great that they could not live together,
[13:7] and there was strife between the herders of Abram's livestock and the herders of Lot's livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land.
[13:8] Then Abram said to Lot, "Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herders and my herders; for we are kindred.
[13:9] Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left."
[13:10] Lot looked about him, and saw that the plain of the Jordan was well watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar; this was before the LORD had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.
[13:11] So Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan, and Lot journeyed eastward; thus they separated from each other.
[13:12] Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the Plain and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
[13:13] Now the people of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the LORD.
[13:14] The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, "Raise your eyes now, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward;
[13:15] for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever.
[13:16] I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth; so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.
[13:17] Rise up, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you."
[13:18] So Abram moved his tent, and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron; and there he built an altar to the LORD.

Chapter 14

[14:1] In the days of King Amraphel of Shinar, King Arioch of Ellasar, King Chedorlaomer of Elam, and King Tidal of Goiim,
[14:2] these kings made war with King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
[14:3] All these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea).
[14:4] Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
[14:5] In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and subdued the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
[14:6] and the Horites in the hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the edge of the wilderness;
[14:7] then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and subdued all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar.
[14:8] Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim
[14:9] with King Chedorlaomer of Elam, King Tidal of Goiim, King Amraphel of Shinar, and King Arioch of Ellasar, four kings against five.
[14:10] Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits; and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the hill country.
[14:11] So the enemy took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way;
[14:12] they also took Lot, the son of Abram's brother, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
[14:13] Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner; these were allies of Abram.
[14:14] When Abram heard that his nephew had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred eighteen of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
[14:15] He divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and routed them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus.
[14:16] Then he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his nephew Lot with his goods, and the women and the people.
[14:17] After his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
[14:18] And King Melchizedek of Salem brought out bread and wine; he was priest of God Most High.
[14:19] He blessed him and said, "Blessed be Abram by God Most High, maker of heaven and earth;
[14:20] and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand!" And Abram gave him one tenth of everything.
[14:21] Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself."
[14:22] But Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have sworn to the LORD, God Most High, maker of heaven and earth,
[14:23] that I would not take a thread or a sandal-thong or anything that is yours, so that you might not say, 'I have made Abram rich.'
[14:24] I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me - Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their share."
Chapter 15

[15:1] After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, "Do not be afraid, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great."
[15:2] But Abram said, "O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?"
[15:3] And Abram said, "You have given me no offspring, and so a slave born in my house is to be my heir."
[15:4] But the word of the LORD came to him, "This man shall not be your heir; no one but your very own issue shall be your heir."
[15:5] He brought him outside and said, "Look toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them." Then he said to him, "So shall your descendants be."
[15:6] And he believed the LORD; and the LORD reckoned it to him as righteousness.
[15:7] Then he said to him, "I am the LORD who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess."
[15:8] But he said, "O Lord GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?"
[15:9] He said to him, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
[15:10] He brought him all these and cut them in two, laying each half over against the other; but he did not cut the birds in two.
[15:11] And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
[15:12] As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a deep and terrifying darkness descended upon him.
[15:13] Then the LORD said to Abram, "Know this for certain, that your offspring shall be aliens in a land that is not theirs, and shall be slaves there, and they shall be oppressed for four hundred years;
[15:14] but I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions.
[15:15] As for yourself, you shall go to your ancestors in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.
[15:16] And they shall come back here in the fourth generation; for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete."
[15:17] When the sun had gone down and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
[15:18] On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,
[15:19] the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
[15:20] the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,
[15:21] the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.".

Chapter 16

[16:1] Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children. She had an Egyptian slave-girl whose name was Hagar,
[16:2] and Sarai said to Abram, "You see that the LORD has prevented me from bearing children; go in to my slave-girl; it may be that I shall obtain children by her." And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
[16:3] So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her slave-girl, and gave her to her husband Abram as a wife.
[16:4] He went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.
[16:5] Then Sarai said to Abram, "May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my slave-girl to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me!"
[16:6] But Abram said to Sarai, "Your slave-girl is in your power; do to her as you please." Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she ran away from her.
[16:7] The angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur.
[16:8] And he said, "Hagar, slave-girl of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?" She said, "I am running away from my mistress Sarai."
[16:9] The angel of the LORD said to her, "Return to your mistress, and submit to her."
[16:10] The angel of the LORD also said to her, "I will so greatly multiply your offspring that they cannot be counted for multitude."
[16:11] And the angel of the LORD said to her, "Now you have conceived and shall bear a son; you shall call him Ishmael, for the LORD has given heed to your affliction.
[16:12] He shall be a wild ass of a man, with his hand against everyone, and everyone's hand against him; and he shall live at odds with all his kin."
[16:13] So she named the LORD who spoke to her, "You are El-roi"; for she said, "Have I really seen God and remained alive after seeing him?"
[16:14] Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; it lies between Kadesh and Bered.
[16:15] Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
[16:16] Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.
Chapter 17

[17:1] When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, "I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless.
[17:2] And I will make my covenant between me and you, and will make you exceedingly numerous."
[17:3] Then Abram fell on his face; and God said to him,
[17:4] "As for me, this is my covenant with you: You shall be the ancestor of a multitude of nations.
[17:5] No longer shall your name be Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you the ancestor of a multitude of nations.
[17:6] I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you.
[17:7] I will establish my covenant between me and you, and your offspring after you throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.
[17:8] And I will give to you, and to your offspring after you, the land where you are now an alien, all the land of Canaan, for a perpetual holding; and I will be their God."
[17:9] God said to Abraham, "As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations.
[17:10] This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
[17:11] You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you.
[17:12] Throughout your generations every male among you shall be circumcised when he is eight days old, including the slave born in your house and the one bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring.
[17:13] Both the slave born in your house and the one bought with your money must be circumcised. So shall my covenant be in your flesh an everlasting covenant.
[17:14] Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant."
[17:15] God said to Abraham, "As for Sarah your wife, you shall not call her Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.
[17:16] I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she shall give rise to nations; kings of peoples shall come from her."
[17:17] Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said to himself, "Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Can Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?"
[17:18] And Abraham said to God, "O that Ishmael might live in your sight!"
[17:19] God said, "No, but your wife Sarah shall bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.
[17:20] As for Ishmael, I have heard you; I will bless him and make him fruitful and exceedingly numerous; he shall be the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.
[17:21] But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this season next year."
[17:22] And when he had finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.
[17:23] Then Abraham took his son Ishmael and all the slaves born in his house or bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very day, as God had said to him.
[17:24] Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
[17:25] And his son Ishmael was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
[17:26] That very day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised;
[17:27] and all the men of his house, slaves born in the house and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
Chapter 18

[18:1] The LORD appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day.
[18:2] He looked up and saw three men standing near him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent entrance to meet them, and bowed down to the ground.
[18:3] He said, "My lord, if I find favor with you, do not pass by your servant.
[18:4] Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
[18:5] Let me bring a little bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on - since you have come to your servant." So they said, "Do as you have said."
[18:6] And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Make ready quickly three measures of choice flour, knead it, and make cakes. "
[18:7] Abraham ran to the herd, and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to the servant, who hastened to prepare it.
[18:8] Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree while they ate.
[18:9] They said to him, "Where is your wife Sarah?" And he said, "There, in the tent."
[18:10] Then one said, "I will surely return to you in due season, and your wife Sarah shall have a son." And Sarah was listening at the tent entrance behind him.
[18:11] Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
[18:12] So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, "After I have grown old, and my husband is old, shall I have pleasure?"
[18:13] The LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, and say, 'Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?'
[18:14] Is anything too wonderful for the LORD? At the set time I will return to you, in due season, and Sarah shall have a son."
[18:15] But Sarah denied, saying, "I did not laugh"; for she was afraid. He said, "Oh yes, you did laugh."
[18:16] Then the men set out from there, and they looked toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to set them on their way.
[18:17] The LORD said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,
[18:18] seeing that Abraham shall become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
[18:19] No, for I have chosen him, that he may charge his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice; so that the LORD may bring about for Abraham what he has promised him."
[18:20] Then the LORD said, "How great is the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah and how very grave their sin!
[18:21] I must go down and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me; and if not, I will know."
[18:22] So the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, while Abraham remained standing before the LORD.
[18:23] Then Abraham came near and said, "Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
[18:24] Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will you then sweep away the place and not forgive it for the fifty righteous who are in it?
[18:25] Far be it from you to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?"
[18:26] And the LORD said, "If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will forgive the whole place for their sake."
[18:27] Abraham answered, "Let me take it upon myself to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes.
[18:28] Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?" And he said, "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there."
[18:29] Again he spoke to him, "Suppose forty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of forty I will not do it."
[18:30] Then he said, "Oh do not let the Lord be angry if I speak. Suppose thirty are found there." He answered, "I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
[18:31] He said, "Let me take it upon myself to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it."
[18:32] Then he said, "Oh do not let the Lord be angry if I speak just once more. Suppose ten are found there." He answered, "For the sake of ten I will not destroy it."
[18:33] And the LORD went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place.

Chapter 19

[19:1] The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them, and bowed down with his face to the ground.
[19:2] He said, "Please, my lords, turn aside to your servant's house and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you can rise early and go on your way." They said, "No; we will spend the night in the square. "
[19:3] But he urged them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
[19:4] But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house;
[19:5] and they called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, so that we may know them."
[19:6] Lot went out of the door to the men, shut the door after him,
[19:7] and said, "I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.
[19:8] Look, I have two daughters who have not known a man; let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please; only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof."
[19:9] But they replied, "Stand back!" And they said, "This fellow came here as an alien, and he would play the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them." Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and came near the door to break it down.
[19:10] But the men inside reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door.
[19:11] And they struck with blindness the men who were at the door of the house, both small and great, so that they were unable to find the door.
[19:12] Then the men said to Lot, "Have you anyone else here? Sons-in- law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city - bring them out of the place.
[19:13] For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it."
[19:14] So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, "Up, get out of this place; for the LORD is about to destroy the city." But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.
[19:15] When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Get up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or else you will be consumed in the punishment of the city."
[19:16] But he lingered; so the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the LORD being merciful to him, and they brought him out and left him outside the city.
[19:17] When they had brought them outside, they said, "Flee for your life; do not look back or stop anywhere in the Plain; flee to the hills, or else you will be consumed."
[19:18] And Lot said to them, "Oh, no, my lords;
[19:19] your servant has found favor with you, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life; but I cannot flee to the hills, for fear the disaster will overtake me and I die.
[19:20] Look, that city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there - is it not a little one?- and my life will be saved!"
[19:21] He said to him, "Very well, I grant you this favor too, and will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.
[19:22] Hurry, escape there, for I can do nothing until you arrive there." Therefore the city was called Zoar.
[19:23] The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
[19:24] Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
[19:25] and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.
[19:26] But Lot's wife, behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
[19:27] Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD;
[19:28] and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the Plain and saw the smoke of the land going up like the smoke of a furnace.
[19:29] So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had settled.
[19:30] Now Lot went up out of Zoar and settled in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar; so he lived in a cave with his two daughters.
[19:31] And the firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the world.
[19:32] Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, so that we may preserve offspring through our father."
[19:33] So they made their father drink wine that night; and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; he did not know when she lay down or when she rose.
[19:34] On the next day, the firstborn said to the younger, "Look, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, so that we may preserve offspring through our father."
[19:35] So they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger rose, and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down or when she rose.
[19:36] Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.
[19:37] The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab; he is the ancestor of the Moabites to this day.
[19:38] The younger also bore a son and named him Ben-ammi; he is the ancestor of the Ammonites to this day.

Chapter 20

[20:1] From there Abraham journeyed toward the region of the Negeb, and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While residing in Gerar as an alien,
[20:2] Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." And King Abimelech of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
[20:3] But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, "You are about to die because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a married woman."
[20:4] Now Abimelech had not approached her; so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent people?
[20:5] Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' I did this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands."
[20:6] Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart; furthermore it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her.
[20:7] Now then, return the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you shall live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you and all that are yours."
[20:8] So Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants and told them all these things; and the men were very much afraid.
[20:9] Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, "What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought such great guilt on me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that ought not to be done."
[20:10] And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What were you thinking of, that you did this thing?"
[20:11] Abraham said, "I did it because I thought, There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.
[20:12] Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
[20:13] And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, 'This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, He is my brother.'"
[20:14] Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves, and gave them to Abraham, and restored his wife Sarah to him.
[20:15] Abimelech said, "My land is before you; settle where it pleases you."
[20:16] To Sarah he said, "Look, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; it is your exoneration before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated."
[20:17] Then Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children.
[20:18] For the LORD had closed fast all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
Chapter 21

[21:1] The LORD dealt with Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as he had promised.
[21:2] Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the time of which God had spoken to him.
[21:3] Abraham gave the name Isaac to his son whom Sarah bore him.
[21:4] And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
[21:5] Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
[21:6] Now Sarah said, "God has brought laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me."
[21:7] And she said, "Who would ever have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age."
[21:8] The child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
[21:9] But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac.
[21:10] So she said to Abraham, "Cast out this slave woman with her son; for the son of this slave woman shall not inherit along with my son Isaac."
[21:11] The matter was very distressing to Abraham on account of his son.
[21:12] But God said to Abraham, "Do not be distressed because of the boy and because of your slave woman; whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for it is through Isaac that offspring shall be named for you.
[21:13] As for the son of the slave woman, I will make a nation of him also, because he is your offspring."
[21:14] So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
[21:15] When the water in the skin was gone, she cast the child under one of the bushes.
[21:16] Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot; for she said, "Do not let me look on the death of the child." And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept.
[21:17] And God heard the voice of the boy; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, and said to her, "What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid; for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.
[21:18] Come, lift up the boy and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make a great nation of him."
[21:19] Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. She went, and filled the skin with water, and gave the boy a drink.
[21:20] God was with the boy, and he grew up; he lived in the wilderness, and became an expert with the bow.
[21:21] He lived in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
[21:22] At that time Abimelech, with Phicol the commander of his army, said to Abraham, "God is with you in all that you do;
[21:23] now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but as I have dealt loyally with you, you will deal with me and with the land where you have resided as an alien."
[21:24] And Abraham said, "I swear it."
[21:25] When Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized,
[21:26] Abimelech said, "I do not know who has done this; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today."
[21:27] So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant.
[21:28] Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock.
[21:29] And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?"
[21:30] He said, "These seven ewe lambs you shall accept from my hand, in order that you may be a witness for me that I dug this well."
[21:31] Therefore that place was called Beer-sheba; because there both of them swore an oath.
[21:32] When they had made a covenant at Beer-sheba, Abimelech, with Phicol the commander of his army, left and returned to the land of the Philistines.
[21:33] Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.
[21:34] And Abraham resided as an alien many days in the land of the Philistines.
Chapter 22

[22:1] After these things God tested Abraham. He said to him, "Abraham!" And he said, "Here I am."
[22:2] He said, "Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I shall show you."
[22:3] So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac; he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and set out and went to the place in the distance that God had shown him.
[22:4] On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place far away.
[22:5] Then Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey; the boy and I will go over there; we will worship, and then we will come back to you."
[22:6] Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together.
[22:7] Isaac said to his father Abraham, "Father!" And he said, "Here I am, my son." He said, "The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
[22:8] Abraham said, "God himself will provide the lamb for a burnt offering, my son." So the two of them walked on together.
[22:9] When they came to the place that God had shown him, Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order. He bound his son Isaac, and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
[22:10] Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to kill his son.
[22:11] But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, and said, "Abraham, Abraham!" And he said, "Here I am."
[22:12] He said, "Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me."
[22:13] And Abraham looked up and saw a ram, caught in a thicket by its horns. Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.
[22:14] So Abraham called that place "The LORD will provide"; as it is said to this day, "On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided."
[22:15] The angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven,
[22:16] and said, "By myself I have sworn, says the LORD: Because you have done this, and have not withheld your son, your only son,
[22:17] I will indeed bless you, and I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of their enemies,
[22:18] and by your offspring shall all the nations of the earth gain blessing for themselves, because you have obeyed my voice."
[22:19] So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham lived at Beer-sheba.
[22:20] Now after these things it was told Abraham, "Milcah also has borne children, to your brother Nahor:
[22:21] Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,
[22:22] Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
[22:23] Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
[22:24] Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.

Chapter 23

[23:1] Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years; this was the length of Sarah's life.
[23:2] And Sarah died at Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan; and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
[23:3] Abraham rose up from beside his dead, and said to the Hittites,
[23:4] "I am a stranger and an alien residing among you; give me property among you for a burying place, so that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
[23:5] The Hittites answered Abraham,
[23:6] "Hear us, my lord; you are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places; none of us will withhold from you any burial ground for burying your dead."
[23:7] Abraham rose and bowed to the Hittites, the people of the land.
[23:8] He said to them, "If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me Ephron son of Zohar,
[23:9] so that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns; it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as a possession for a burying place."
[23:10] Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who went in at the gate of his city,
[23:11] "No, my lord, hear me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it; in the presence of my people I give it to you; bury your dead."
[23:12] Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.
[23:13] He said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, "If you only will listen to me! I will give the price of the field; accept it from me, so that I may bury my dead there."
[23:14] Ephron answered Abraham,
[23:15] "My lord, listen to me; a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver - what is that between you and me? Bury your dead."
[23:16] Abraham agreed with Ephron; and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.
[23:17] So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, passed
[23:18] to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites, in the presence of all who went in at the gate of his city.
[23:19] After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah facing Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
[23:20] The field and the cave that is in it passed from the Hittites into Abraham's possession as a burying place.
Chapter 24

[24:1] Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years; and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
[24:2] Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his house, who had charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh
[24:3] and I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live,
[24:4] but will go to my country and to my kindred and get a wife for my son Isaac."
[24:5] The servant said to him, "Perhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me to this land; must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?"
[24:6] Abraham said to him, "See to it that you do not take my son back there.
[24:7] The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me and swore to me, 'To your offspring I will give this land,' he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.
[24:8] But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there."
[24:9] So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.
[24:10] Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed, taking all kinds of choice gifts from his master; and he set out and went to Aram-naharaim, to the city of Nahor.
[24:11] He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water; it was toward evening, the time when women go out to draw water.
[24:12] And he said, "O LORD, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.
[24:13] I am standing here by the spring of water, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.
[24:14] Let the girl to whom I shall say, 'Please offer your jar that I may drink,' and who shall say, 'Drink, and I will water your camels' - let her be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master."
[24:15] Before he had finished speaking, there was Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, coming out with her water jar on her shoulder.
[24:16] The girl was very fair to look upon, a virgin, whom no man had known. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up.
[24:17] Then the servant ran to meet her and said, "Please let me sip a little water from your jar."
[24:18] "Drink, my lord," she said, and quickly lowered her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink.
[24:19] When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, "I will draw for your camels also, until they have finished drinking."
[24:20] So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels.
[24:21] The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful.
[24:22] When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold nose- ring weighing a half shekel, and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels,
[24:23] and said, "Tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?"
[24:24] She said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."
[24:25] She added, "We have plenty of straw and fodder and a place to spend the night."
[24:26] The man bowed his head and worshiped the LORD
[24:27] and said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the way to the house of my master's kin."
[24:28] Then the girl ran and told her mother's household about these things.
[24:29] Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.
[24:30] As soon as he had seen the nose-ring, and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekah, "Thus the man spoke to me," he went to the man; and there he was, standing by the camels at the spring.
[24:31] He said, "Come in, O blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand outside when I have prepared the house and a place for the camels?"
[24:32] So the man came into the house; and Laban unloaded the camels, and gave him straw and fodder for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
[24:33] Then food was set before him to eat; but he said, "I will not eat until I have told my errand." He said, "Speak on."
[24:34] So he said, "I am Abraham's servant.
[24:35] The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become wealthy; he has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female slaves, camels and donkeys.
[24:36] And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and he has given him all that he has.
[24:37] My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live;
[24:38] but you shall go to my father's house, to my kindred, and get a wife for my son.'
[24:39] I said to my master, 'Perhaps the woman will not follow me.'
[24:40] But he said to me, 'The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you and make your way successful. You shall get a wife for my son from my kindred, from my father's house.
[24:41] Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my kindred; even if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.'
[24:42] "I came today to the spring, and said, 'O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now you will only make successful the way I am going!
[24:43] I am standing here by the spring of water; let the young woman who comes out to draw, to whom I shall say, "Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,"
[24:44] and who will say to me, "Drink, and I will draw for your camels also"- let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master's son.'
[24:45] "Before I had finished speaking in my heart, there was Rebekah coming out with her water jar on her shoulder; and she went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'
[24:46] She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder, and said, 'Drink, and I will also water your camels.' So I drank, and she also watered the camels.
[24:47] Then I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.' So I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her arms.
[24:48] Then I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way to obtain the daughter of my master's kinsman for his son.
[24:49] Now then, if you will deal loyally and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so that I may turn either to the right hand or to the left."
[24:50] Then Laban and Bethuel answered, "The thing comes from the LORD; we cannot speak to you anything bad or good.
[24:51] Look, Rebekah is before you, take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has spoken."
[24:52] When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the ground before the LORD.
[24:53] And the servant brought out jewelry of silver and of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments.
[24:54] Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they rose in the morning, he said, "Send me back to my master."
[24:55] Her brother and her mother said, "Let the girl remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go."
[24:56] But he said to them, "Do not delay me, since the LORD has made my journey successful; let me go that I may go to my master."
[24:57] They said, "We will call the girl, and ask her."
[24:58] And they called Rebekah, and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" She said, "I will."
[24:59] So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse along with Abraham's servant and his men.
[24:60] And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, "May you, our sister, become thousands of myriads; may your offspring gain possession of the gates of their foes."
[24:61] Then Rebekah and her maids rose up, mounted the camels, and followed the man; thus the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
[24:62] Now Isaac had come from Beer-lahai-roi, and was settled in the Negeb.
[24:63] Isaac went out in the evening to walk in the field; and looking up, he saw camels coming.
[24:64] And Rebekah looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she slipped quickly from the camel,
[24:65] and said to the servant, "Who is the man over there, walking in the field to meet us?" The servant said, "It is my master." So she took her veil and covered herself.
[24:66] And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
[24:67] Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent. He took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
Chapter 25

[25:1] Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah.
[25:2] She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
[25:3] Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
[25:4] The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
[25:5] Abraham gave all he had to Isaac.
[25:6] But to the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts, while he was still living, and he sent them away from his son Isaac, eastward to the east country.
[25:7] This is the length of Abraham's life, one hundred seventy-five years.
[25:8] Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people.
[25:9] His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, east of Mamre,
[25:10] the field that Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried, with his wife Sarah.
[25:11] After the death of Abraham God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac settled at Beer-lahai-roi.
[25:12] These are the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's slave-girl, bore to Abraham.
[25:13] These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, named in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael; and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
[25:14] Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
[25:15] Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
[25:16] These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their tribes.
[25:17] (This is the length of the life of Ishmael, one hundred thirty- seven years; he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.)
[25:18] They settled from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria; he settled down alongside of all his people.
[25:19] These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham was the father of Isaac,
[25:20] and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, sister of Laban the Aramean.
[25:21] Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD granted his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived.
[25:22] The children struggled together within her; and she said, "If it is to be this way, why do I live?" So she went to inquire of the LORD.
[25:23] And the LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples born of you shall be divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the elder shall serve the younger."
[25:24] When her time to give birth was at hand, there were twins in her womb.
[25:25] The first came out red, all his body like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau.
[25:26] Afterward his brother came out, with his hand gripping Esau's heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
[25:27] When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.
[25:28] Isaac loved Esau, because he was fond of game; but Rebekah loved Jacob.
[25:29] Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.
[25:30] Esau said to Jacob, "Let me eat some of that red stuff, for I am famished!" (Therefore he was called Edom.)
[25:31] Jacob said, "First sell me your birthright."
[25:32] Esau said, "I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?"
[25:33] Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.
[25:34] Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
