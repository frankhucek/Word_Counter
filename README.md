# Word_Counter

This is my third project for my Data Structures and Algorithms project.
The word counter uses a Hash Table as the data structure to hold words
and their frequencies.
The Hash Table uses separate chaining of Linked Lists for each index within
the Hash Table.
When an item is hashed to a specific index, it is added to that index's
Linked List.

In the future, I may make a generic Hash Table using the open addressing
hash technique with dual hash functions, as I much prefer this method.
